So, Let me introduce myself my full name is <strong>Rifqi Fajar Pratama</strong> And my nick name is Rifqi. But you can call me fajar, iqi, or qijar. And there's a funny stories about qijar's name . So, I have a friend name Rifa. The first we met, we told each other names and when i said "you can call me rifqi or fajar" and she was confused about calling me what. So she merged both names and now she called me qijar. hahaha this is funny, right?. I was born in Bogor on 24th january 2001. I am the first child of two siblings. My father's name is Dedi Suhendar. My father worked as a Private Employee. And my mother's name is Yati Kaniawati, she is a Housewife. I have a sister her name is Alya Shakila Ramadhani. She is 5 (five) years old, and oh my God! she's so annoying!. But even she's so annoying I really love her, I love her so much and of course I love all my family!</p>
